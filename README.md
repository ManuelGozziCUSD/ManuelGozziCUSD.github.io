Personal Portfolio Mockup
--------------------------------
    This website was designed for html/css/js practice,
    however it has turned out quite nicely.
    Despite the appearance, the code can be compressed into html partials 
    given that many of the elements are only unique because of the images that they 
    contain.
    A script may be run locally on the users machine or the raw html can be generated 
    on the dev machine which can convert one text file and a group of images into a 
    fully working demo. 
    This script has not yet been established as of yet because I do not have a 
    real computer.
    I have a school provided chromebook which is limited to the capabilities of the web. 
    I intend to finish this project in the future once I have obtained the necessary hardware.
